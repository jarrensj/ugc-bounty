## ugc bounty

Brands / Parties can submit bounties (deposit a sum of money and the rate per 1k views). Anyone (users) can submit content (tiktok, youtube, twitter) and get part of the bounty. Our app checks using AI if the content actually includes the campaign requirements (example campaign: make a video wearing this sushi hat) and check if the hat is in the video. We also check the views of the content.
