## ugc bounty

A platform connecting brands with content creators through bounty-based campaigns.

**How it works:**
- **Brands** create bounties by depositing funds and setting a rate per 1,000 views
- **Creators** submit content (TikTok, YouTube, Twitter) to fulfill campaign requirements
- **AI validation** automatically verifies that submissions meet campaign criteria (e.g., checking if a product appears in the video)
- **View tracking** monitors content performance and calculates payouts accordingly

**User Management:**
- Integrated with **Clerk** for secure authentication and user management
- **User profiles** display:
  - Bounties/campaigns you've created
  - Submissions you've made to other bounties
  - Track your earnings and campaign performance
